# Blood-Donation-Prediction

Predicting potential blood donors based on past donation behaviour


# Problem Statement

• Over 12,000 persons die every day in India due to the unavailability of blood. <br />
• The reason to donate is simple. It helps save lives. <br />
• In fact, every two seconds of every day, someone needs blood. <br />

• Ensuring that there is enough blood on hand whenever it is required is a significant challenge for the medical community. <br />

# Solution

• Our focus is on building a web application predicting potential blood donors.<br />
• The parameters which is collected from each donors which include recency, frequency, monetary, time and a binary variable representing whether he/she donated blood or not. <br />
• Data exploration has been carried out in order to determine the correlation between the various factors. <br />
• Then, we developed a predictive model to aid in the identification of potential donors based on their past donation behavior. <br />

# Requirements

• Python <br />
• Scikit-learn <br />
• Flask <br />
• Html <br />
• CSS <br />
